        <h1>Project 1 Rubric</h1>
        <h2>Content</h2>
        <ul>
                <li>Is the content original, not placeholder text or copy lifted from elsewhere?<br /><span>Yes, all of
                                the
                                HTML,
                                CSS, and JavaScript are my own creation. However, some aspects rely on your videos. All
                                of the text was
                                provided by Grace Barnes.</span></li>
                <li>Does the site encorporate a form element?<br /><span>Yes, it is on the contact page but only
                                provides an
                                alert that it does not work. There is also an option to switch to the working google
                                form.</span></li>
                <li>Does the site include links to other sites?<br /><span>Yes, there is a link to Grace's instagram at
                                the
                                bottom of the page and a link that opens your mail at the contact page and a link to a
                                google
                                form.</span></li>
                <li>Are there the required five seperate pages?<br /><span>Yes, there is an index page which is
                                basically the
                                landing page. There is an originals page which only contains artworks that are original
                                creations. There
                                is the studies page which only contains artwork that is a replication of someone elses
                                work or a figure.
                                There is the contact page which allows the user to submit a commission request. There is
                                the about page
                                which contains the artist statement.</span></li>
                <li>Does the page include a favicon?<br /><span>Yes, it is her self portrait.</span></li>
                <li>Does the page include an animation?<br /><span>Yes, there are a couple animations, but the most
                                noticeable
                                one is the one that occurs when you hover over a page header.</span></li>
                <li>Is a <a href="report.html">report.html</a> included that summarizes how the project requirements
                        were
                        met?<br /><span>Yes, you are currently viewing that page.</span></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Coherence and Contrast</h2>
        <ul>
                <li>Are the images appropriate to the theme?<br /><span>Yes, all images were provided by Grace Barnes
                                and are
                                pictures of her work.</span></li>
                <li>Are the images appropriately sized?<br /><span>Yes, they are all sized so that their proportions are
                                not
                                distorted and they do not take up too much space. They are also big enough so you can
                                see the
                                details.</span></li>
                <li>Are there strong axes of alignment?<br /><span>Yes, accross the entire site I maintained a left axes
                                of
                                alignment with three exceptions. First the title is center aligned. Second the nav bar
                                is right aligned.
                                Third the instagram link is centered.</span></li>
                <li>Is your style maintained across pages?<br /><span>Yes, I use the same color theme and font theme
                                accrose the
                                entire site. Pages with common styles share common style sheets to ensure this.</span>
                </li>
                <li>Is the spacing clean?<br /><span>Yes, items that are related are closer than items that are not. The
                                size
                                of the spacing also changes based on how close the items are related.</span></li>
                <li>Does the site include different fonts?<br /><span>Yes, for the body of the text, I use the google
                                font
                                Roboto with the sans-serif style. For h1 texts, I use the Roboto-slab font with the
                                serif style. For the
                                title in the landing page and the h2 headers, I use Roboto condensed with the sans-serif
                                style.</span>
                </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Client-mindedness</h2>
        <ul>
                <li>Is the site designed with the client in mind rather than the designer?<br /><span>Yes, Grace helped
                                decide
                                what the five pages were going to be and approved layouts I provided. Grace also helped
                                decide the color
                                scheme.</span></li>
                <li>Does your site appear appropriately on both mobile and desktop screen?<br /><span>Yes, I used media
                                queries
                                to define layouts for three different screen sizes: screens with a width less than 650,
                                less than 1200,
                                and above 1200. When the screen is less than 650 the nav bar changes to a mobile
                                version.</span></li>
                <li>Is your site arranged in a navigable way?<br /><span>Yes, there is both a header with nav links and
                                a footer
                                with nav links. Both of these adjust with the size of the device. Both of these are
                                available on every
                                page. Section titles also contain nav links.</span></li>
                <li>Are images made accessible with alt attributes?<br /><span>Yes, every image has a descritption in an
                                alt
                                tag.</span></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Project Organization</h2>
        <ul>
                <li>Are external CSS files used?<br /><span>Yes, the main.css file contains styles that are used by all
                                HTML
                                pages. The artwork.css file contains styles that are used by pages that contain an
                                artwork card. The
                                index, about, and contact CSS pages only contain styles relevant to those pages. The
                                report.css file
                                contains styles for this page.</span></li>
                <li>Is the site organized into files as specified?<br /><span>Yes, all HTML files are at the root level
                                (in the
                                project1 folder). All CSS files are in the css folder. All JavaScript files are in the
                                js folder. All
                                images are in the images folder.</span></li>
                <li>Are classes and IDs used appropriately to apply styles at the right level of
                        granularity?<br /><span>Yes,
                                IDs are only used once per ID and classes are only used for items of the same tag that
                                have the same
                                style. ID and class names are also descriptors of what the item represents in the
                                site.</span></li>
                <li>Are selectors used appropriately?<br /><span>Yes, any time a style is applied the lowest level of
                                selectors
                                are used. A class name or ID is used if avalable or the '>' key is used to select
                                children of a certain
                                type.</span></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Technical Soundness</h2>
        <ul>
                <li>Are lowercase filenames used?<br /><span>Yes, all of the files included only include alphabetical
                                numbers
                                and are lowercase. This did get a little confusing though because all of the images have
                                really long
                                file names and are multiple words long, so it just kinda blends together. I would have
                                probably
                                otherwise used camelcase for the images.</span></li>
                <li>Is the site served over HTTPS on port 443?<br /><span>Yes, I followed the instructions in the
                                project 1
                                setup instructions to acheive this.</span></li>
                <li>Does the port 80 redirect to port 443?<br /><span>Yes, I followed the instructions in the project 1
                                setup
                                instructions to acheive this.</span></li>
                <li>Is the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript readable?<br /><span>Yes, I included spacing between related
                                sections and
                                comments.</span></li>
                <li>Does your HTML and CSS pass all validation?<br /><span>Yes, I had to fix two things when I checked
                                in the Nu
                                validator. First, I had a ul tag in a p tag. Second, I had a CSS line where I tried to
                                set align-items
                                to top, which is not valid.</span></li>
                <li>Is the site created without the aid of other libraries or frameworks?<br /><span>Yes, the only thing
                                I
                                imported was the google fonts everything else is from my original creation or based on
                                your
                                videos.</span></li>
                <li>Was there a steady flow of commits to Git?<br /><span>Yes, I made 23 different commits on 13
                                different days.
                                The first commit was Tuesday September 22nd and the most recent commit was Thursday
                                October 15th. This
                                means I word on the project 13 out of the 24 days since I started it. Some days that I
                                had more than two
                                commits are not because I had more than two work seessions, but because I noticed a typo
                                or something
                                after commiting and pushed another commit right after. </span></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Client Review</h2>
        <ul>
                <li>Response from Grace:<br /><span>I really love the way the website turned out. I really like how easy
                                it is to navigate and use. I think that the fact it is user friendly will help promote
                                business.</span></li>
        </ul>
