                        (3x4ft) acrylic on canvas. This is a commissioned piece of the client's pets. It is a satirical
                        piece where the animals are posing as a 17th century family. The frame and wallpaper are also
                        painted.

                    <p>
                        (3x3ft) mixed media on canvas. This piece is a collection of symbols used in the Black Lives
                        Matter Movement. In the silhouette of the black women in the center of the piece, are the names
                        of those affected by police brutality. The collection of various materials on the piece
                        represents the African diaspora, or the spreading of people from their original homeland. The
                        melting pot that is America, is shown here as a mixed media piece.

                    <h3>Skulls in Pink</h3>
                    <p>
                        (3x4ft) acrylic on canvas. This is a vanitas painting, meaning it is a symbolic work depicting
                        life, pleasure, and the certainty of death. The skull and unlit candle are representative of
                        death, the growing, potted flowers represent life, and the perfume, makeup, wine bottles, and
                        articles of clothing are the pleasures of life.

                    <p>
                        (11”x14”) acrylic on canvas. This is a commission piece, where I included her daughter in the
                        process. Together we created the background of handprints, and she helped choose the colors.
                        Then I painted the daughters silhouette and painted the words of the clients choosing.

                        (3.5x4ft) oil based ink on paper. Inspired by the Netflix Original Series “Dear White People”.
                        The figure depicted is the main character of the series, mono-printed in red, blue, and purple.
                        The colors chosen represent the politically driven issues raised in the show. This piece is a
                        mix of mono printing with ink, and citra solv transfers.

                    <h3>Diary Unfolded</h3>
                    <p>
                        mixed media. This piece was created by sewing and tapping large pieces of mixed media paper
                        together in an organic form. I then toned the paper with watercolor paint and used ink, paint,
                        markers, pastels, chalk, makeup, and graphite to create a piece inspired by my middle school
                        diary.

                    <h3>Still Life in Graphite</h3>
                    <p>
                        (2x4ft) graphite on paper. This piece was drawn from life over the course of a few weeks. The
                        focus of this piece was realism and using a new technique of building up graphite. There is no
                        pressure put on this paper to make darker areas, ideally, this whole piece could be erased back
                        to bright white. The objects in this piece are life sized.
