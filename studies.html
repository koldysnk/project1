                    <p>
                        (18”x24”) acrylic on canvas. This piece is a recreation of Artemisia Gentileschi’s painting. The
                        study was focusing on recreating something as exact as possible. The expression of ecstasy on
                        her face was the hardest and most important part of making this recreation.

                    <h3>Poussin Study in Acrylic</h3>
                    <p>
                        (11”x14”) acrylic on canvas. This study focuses on using only three tones of the same color to
                        create a work of art. It focuses heavily on the shapes and shades that create form and
                        atmosphere.

                        (9”x12”) charcoal on mixed media paper. This portrait was drawn from life and the woman shown is
                        the figure model. The study was done in one sitting and was focusing on capturing the emotion
                        and peacefulness of the model.

                    <p>
                        Acrylic on scrap wood. This study was painted from life. The vibrancy of the colors and the
                        atmosphere were intensified but the figure was painted as close to life as possible. This study
                        was focusing on the anatomy of the figure.

                    <p>
                        (2x3ft) acrylic on canvas. This was a commissioned work inspired by a concentration I created in
                        2016-2017. The focus of my concentration was the human body in its most vulnerable and exposed
                        form, on top of a dark background, with exaggerated, abstract color adorning the skin.

                        commission work. I focused on mastering the texture of skin and pushing my darker tones.
